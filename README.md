# Word Analyzer

This Python script analyzes the frequency of words in a given text.

## Functions

The script contains two main functions:

1. `analyze_text(text)`: This function takes a string of text as input, splits it into words, counts the total number of words, and counts the occurrences of each word. It returns the total number of words and a dictionary of word counts.

2. `main()`: This function is the main driver of the script. It welcomes the user and enters a loop where it continually asks the user for text to analyze. If the user types 'exit', the program ends. Otherwise, it calls `analyze_text` on the input text and prints the results.

## Usage

To use this script, simply run it in a Python environment. When prompted, enter the text you want to analyze. The script will print the total number of words and the count of each word in the text.

To exit the program, type 'exit'.
